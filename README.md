Here’s a clear and concise README.md you can use for your GitHub repository for your House Price Prediction Model:

🏠 House Price Prediction Model
This project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features like area, number of rooms, location, and more. The goal is to help understand how different factors affect house prices and build a tool that can estimate property values with reasonable accuracy.

📂 Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and performing feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed data distributions, correlations, and visualized key insights.

Model Training: Trained different regression models and selected the best-performing one.

Evaluation: Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

Deployment: The trained model is saved using pickle and can be integrated into a web application (e.g., using Streamlit).

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Pickle

Streamlit for deployment
